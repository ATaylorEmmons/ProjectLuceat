# ProjectLuceat

A game engine written in C# using the MonoGame framework.

Uses an Scenes and an Entity Component System to manage game objects. 

# Brief reminder on building scenes
1) Scenes contain some default objects (A camera, particle system, sprite system, etc). 
2) A scene also contains a Root node which is to be the parent for all other entities.
3) Entities contain components to modify behavior.
